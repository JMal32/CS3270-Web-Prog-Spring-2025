<h3>Directory structure – keep or change?</h3>
<p><strong>I'm leaving the original SpielByWeb structure untouched.
    It keeps every path in the captured HTML valid and saves re‑wiring later PHP.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Official component counts</h3>

<p><strong>
    Larva cubes – 10 of each colour (50 total)<br>
    <br>
    Polyp tiles – 40 of each colour (200 total)<br>
    <br>
    Shrimp – 4 per player (up to 16)<br>
    <br>
    Dominance tiles – 10 total
  </strong></p>

<h3>Suggested data‑structures &amp; helper functions</h3>

<pre><code class="php">
    // supply pools
    $polyp = ['w'=>40,'y'=>40,'o'=>40,'p'=>40,'g'=>40];
    $larva = ['w'=>10,'y'=>10,'o'=>10,'p'=>10,'g'=>10];

    // players
    $player = [
    0 => ['tiles'=>[], 'cubes'=>[], 'shrimp'=>['sG.gif','sG.gif','sG.gif','sG.gif']],
    1 => ['tiles'=>[], 'cubes'=>[], 'shrimp'=>['sP.gif','sP.gif','sP.gif','sP.gif']]
    ];

    // give first player 6 random tiles
    for ($i=0; $i<6; $i++) { $c=array_rand($polyp); // pick colour key $player[0]['tiles'][]="p{$c}.jpg" ; $polyp[$c]--;
      // reduce supply } </code>
</pre>
